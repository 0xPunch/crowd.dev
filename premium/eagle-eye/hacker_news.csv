mathiasn,32422871,20,1660205387,Launch HN: AccessOwl (YC S22) – Automating SaaS Provisioning and Permissioning,,"Hey HN, we are Mathias and Philip, co-founders of AccessOwl (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accessowl.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accessowl.io&#x2F;</a>). AccessOwl automates your employees&#x27; access to SaaS products. We give you a simple way to provision and deprovision any SaaS tool, as well as to configure permission levels. See a demo here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accessowl.io&#x2F;productdemo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accessowl.io&#x2F;productdemo</a>.<p>Most of us use SaaS tools for work day-in and day-out. How do we get access to those tools? For the most part, through a colleague or IT admin who creates all accounts and sets permissions manually.<p>Here’s what it usually looks like for the unfortunate admin: (1) receive a request for a new tool via email, Slack, JIRA or face-to-face. Since you are busy with something else, you write a todo for later; (2) you log in to the tool and realize that the permission that was requested is way too high so you check in with the requestor’s manager; (3) you finally set up the account and document user, tool and permission in a Gsheet&#x2F;Notion&#x2F;Airtable.<p>This quickly becomes a 30m task for a simple access request! This is still the best practice for most people and it sadly also was for us. We were both founders before and experienced the same tedious process in different flavors at our own startups and other companies.<p>At some point we migrated to Okta and partially automated our provisioning and deprovisioning (permissioning, however, stayed painfully manual). Why only partially automated? Because Okta utilizes the SCIM API which was either not available in our tool stack or required an expensive upgrade to enterprise-subscription (thanks to the “sso tax”: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31175300"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31175300</a>). And yet, we still missed simple things such as approval steps, a straightforward way to request access, and access reviews.<p>We talked to hundreds of organizations and saw the same manual processes and self-built scripts everywhere. The pain often starts at growing companies with around 50 employees. At this stage the CTO usually gets fed up with manually (de)provisioning and documenting it in a Gsheet. Another widespread cause of headache are IT security certifications (e.g. SOC2, ISO27001,...), requiring to know which employee has access to what tool, regular access reviews, and timely offboardings.<p>It seemed crazy that in a world where SaaS has become the norm, there was no great way to manage something as seemingly “trivial”, but also as critical, as user accounts. The core issues are, as always, missing integrations. Despite SCIM being the standard for over a decade, not all applications are utilizing it. Worse, many vendors lock it up in their enterprise plan.<p>This brought us to our core design principle: AccessOwl has to work with every tool, no matter what integrations are available. We generalize all the available ways of integrations in a single, simple interface. We take care of all the grunt work needed to coax each SaaS tool into doing the right thing. Whether it’s calling public APIs or resorting to Plaid-style automations as a last resort. Our first iteration was a simple workflow in Slack (Request -&gt; Approve -&gt; Manual provision). It covered all access documentation and solved back-and-forth communication between stakeholders. Since then, we have been adding more and more integrations to SaaS tools to directly (de)provision without the use of SCIM APIs. Taking a similar approach to provisioning as “Plaid” did in banking. We’re already covering 100+ tools and counting.<p>So what does a typical workflow look like?!<p>Step 1: Request an access, onboarding or offboarding. For this we piggy-back on whatever messaging tool is used in your org (we are starting with Slack, Teams will follow). It’s as simple as clicking a button to get your request started (no more manual JIRA tickets!) and always gets forwarded to the right stakeholders.<p>Step 2: Provisioning and permissioning. In the most basic workflow the tool owner receives the approved request with all the information to manually provision the account. If and when you arrive at the point where manual provisioning becomes a pain, you can let us automate it for you. The requestor will automatically get process updates and the access will be audit-ready logged in the background.<p>Prices start at $2.5 per employee per month and we charge a fixed premium for the automation of (de)provisioning based on the total number of employees.<p>We are excited for the opportunity to share AccessOwl with you! We would be more than excited to hear your thoughts and feedback and your own experiences with SaaS access management!",Hacker News,68093028

neutralino1,32413070,104,1660143410,Launch HN: Sematic (YC S22) – Open-source framework to build ML pipelines faster,,"Hi HN – I’m Emmanuel, founder of Sematic (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sematic.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sematic.dev</a>). Sematic is an open-source framework to prototype and productionize end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS) pipelines in days instead of weeks or months. The idea is to do for ML development what Rails and Heroku did for web development.<p>I started my career searching for Supersymmetry and the Higgs boson on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, then moved to industry. I spent the last four years building ML infrastructure at Cruise. In both academia and industry, I witnessed researchers, data scientists, and ML engineers spending an absurd share of their time building makeshift tooling, stitching up infrastructure, and battling obscure systems, instead of focusing on their core area of expertise: extracting insights and predictions from data.<p>This was painfully apparent at Cruise where the ML Platform team needed to grow linearly with the number of users to support and models to ship to the car. What should have just taken a click (e.g. retraining a model when world conditions change – COVID parklets, road construction sites, deployment to new cities) often required weeks of painstaking work. Existing tools for prototyping and productionizing ML&#x2F;DS models did not enable developers to become autonomous and tackle new projects instead of babysitting current ones.<p>For example, a widely adopted tool such as Kubeflow Pipelines requires users to learn an obscure Python API, package and deploy their code and dependencies by hand, and does not offer exhaustive tracking and visualization of artifacts beyond simple metadata.<p>In order to become autonomous, users needed a dead-simple way to iterate seamlessly between local and cloud environments (change code, validate locally, run at scale in the cloud, repeat) and visualize objects (metrics, plots, datasets, configs) in a UI. Strong guarantees around dependency packaging, traceability of artifact lineage, and reproducibility would have to be provided out-of-the-box.<p>Sematic lets ML&#x2F;DS developers build and run pipelines of arbitrary complexity with nothing more than minimalistic Python APIs. Business logic, dynamic pipeline graphs, configurations, resource requirements, etc. — all with only Python. We are bringing the lovable aspects of Jupyter Notebooks (iterative development, visualizations) to the actual pipeline.<p>How it works: Sematic resolves dynamic nested graphs of pipeline steps (simple Python functions) and intercepts all inputs and outputs of each step to type-check, serialize, version, and track them. Individual steps are orchestrated as Kubernetes jobs according to required resources (e.g. GPU, high-memory), and all tracking and visualization information is surfaced in a modern UI. Build assets (user code, third-party dependencies, drivers, static libraries) are packaged and shipped to remote workers at runtime, which enables a fast and seamless iterative development experience.<p>Sematic lets you achieve results much faster by not wasting time on packaging dependencies, foraging for output artifacts to visualize, investigating obscure failures in black-box container jobs, bookkeeping configurations, writing complex YAML templates to run multiple experiments, etc.<p>It can run on a local machine or be deployed to leverage cloud resources (e.g. GPUs, high-memory instances, map&#x2F;reduce clusters, etc.) with minimal external dependencies: Python, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes.<p>Sematic is open-source and free to use locally or self-hosted in your own cloud. We will provide a SaaS offering to enable access to cloud resources without the hassle of maintaining a cloud deployment.
To get started, simply run `$ pip install sematic; sematic start`.

rubenfiszel,32400849,203,1660065558,Launch HN: Windmill (YC S22) – Turn scripts into internal apps and workflows,,"Ruben here, software engineer, long-time lurker of Hacker News and founder of Windmill. Windmill is a fully open-source self-hostable platform and runtime to build complex workflows, internal apps and integrations using any scripts in Python or Typescript-deno. I am back after having been revealed a bit too soon on HN and miraculously getting into YC (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31272793"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31272793</a>).<p>To build internal apps for ops, integrations between services that cannot talk to each other directly, or to run background jobs that run your business logic and analytics, the two main options today are no-code solutions and old-fashioned, roll-your-own scripting. Both have problems, and our goal with Windmill is to find a new sweet spot between the two. No-code solutions are productive <i>if</i> your problem matches the tool exactly - but it not, they are rigid, hard to extend and quickly become tech debt, annihilating their initial time advantage. Indeed, no-code is just code but made by an opinionated someone else and hidden as a blackbox with an UI.<p>The alternative is to do it the old-fashioned way, writing everything from scratch, both backend and frontend, perhaps deploying it on the latest flavor of serverless, and pray to never have to touch it again because that took way too much time and it has now became a burden that the ops and business team might poke you about regularly.<p>Furthermore, the landscape of SaaS is specialized tools for everything—alerting, data analytics, administration panels, support management, integration between services—when it feels like a few scripts would have been as good or even better and spared you the need of depending on one yet another tool. This could be even further facilitated if there was a way to import the right bunch of scripts from a fellow community of engineers, tweak it and deploy it like you can do in communities where automation can be shared as simple JSON files, for instance in the node-red or home assistant community.. That’s the idea of Windmill: to bring back the power of scripting in an easy way.<p>With Windmill, you write normal scripts, or reuse ones made by others, and we make them production-grade and composable. You shouldn’t have to worry about things like http requests or scheduling jobs. We abstract much of that away, making your scripts be both more focused and more composable. You end up doing things the right way but much quicker.<p>We reduce the complexity of workflows, integrations and internal apps by uniting them all under one banner. At the heart, they mostly have the same needs: workflows with a UI or a schedule. One tool that does it all out-of-the-box offers greater consistency and allows you to grow the complexity of your toolset at your own pace.<p>I have an academic background in compilers and industry experience in distributed systems. My compiler work made me wary of solving every problem with a domain-specific-language (DSL) or complex frameworks. We can just do more with the well-crafted existing languages like Python or Typescript.  Rolling up your own DSL is nice in theory, you can make it very ergonomic and focused on the task at hand, but then you start adding features and either reinvent existing – albeit worse – programming language or decide to stop there. In the very large majority of cases, a well crafted library is vastly superior to any DSL. By being able to use any library of Python and Typescript, we stand on the shoulders of giants.<p>I have also observed that the best distributed systems are often the most simple as they are more predictable and have invariants that are easier to reason with and scale horizontally. This is why for Windmill, we rely solely on Postgres + our native workers + our http REST api layer. Later on, we plan to build adapters to host the workers on AWS lambda or Cloudflare workers, and the queue on Kafka if your needs are exceptionally high.<p>At the heart of what we have built is a queue implemented in Postgres and workers implemented in Rust that create a sandbox (using nsjail), fetch dependencies, and execute  scripts. Every script can be triggered through its name  with an HTTP POST by passing a JSON payload in which every field corresponds 1:1 to an argument of the script’s main parameters. Most primitive types in Python or Typescript have a natural corresponding type in JSON so the conversion is always what you would expect.  We then execute the script inside a new sandbox and then store the results in the same Postgres DB at the end of the job execution.<p>The HTTP payload can be sent from your own frontend or you can use our automatically generated UI. Indeed, we do a simple, yet effective analysis of the parameters of your script, and from it, generate the jsonschema corresponding to your parameters. That schema is what enables us to convert any script into a no-code like module for flows, or a standalone internal app with its auto-generated UI. In the case of Python, we also look at the imports to deduce the Pypi dependencies without you having to declare them.<p>For flows, we defined an open spec for building them out of those scripts we call OpenFlow: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.windmill.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;openflow"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.windmill.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;openflow</a>. It  is essentially a json format for describing a sequence of steps with for loops and soon branching. The most interesting bit here is that each input of each step can define its input as a javascript expression that refers to and transforms the output of any previous step. We make it fast by leveraging native v8 integration in Rust (thanks to the deno team) for executing those expressions. This makes this apparently linear sequence a flexible DAG in which one can express complex workflows.<p>Then on top of that we have an UI builder for flows that hides most of the complexity to give an experience that is similar to a low-code platform where every step is treated as a blackbox. The platform itself offers all the features that you would expect: a variable and object store for storing states, plain values and credentials; a cron scheduler, tight permissioning for the sensitive credentials, groups, a webeditor with smart assistant to edit the scripts directly in the platform etc. Finally, we made a hub (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.windmill.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.windmill.dev</a>) to share flows and scripts with everyone. The goal is to grow over time an exhaustive library of pre-made modules and flows to tweak from so that you can focus on what is actually custom to you.<p>Windmill is open-source and self-hostable. You can think of it as a superset of both Pipedream and Airplane.dev. Compared to Temporal, the scripts themselves are agnostic of the flow in which they are embedded, which has the benefit of making it easier to build a hub of reusable modules. We are the only ones as far as we know to convert script parameters to UI automatically. We see ourselves as complementary to UI builder solutions like Retool or Tooljet as we do not want to focus too much on the auto-generated UI and could be used solely as the backend part of the two aforementioned tools.<p>We are now a team of 3 senior engineers and the product is progressing faster than ever with a public roadmap: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orgs&#x2F;windmill-labs&#x2F;projects&#x2F;2"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orgs&#x2F;windmill-labs&#x2F;projects&#x2F;2</a><p>We make money from commercial licenses, support and team plans on the hosted solution.<p>You can self-host it or try it  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.windmill.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.windmill.dev</a>, the free tier is generous (and the paid one is not enforced yet).

fabiendevos,32388410,171,1659979549,Launch HN: Wolfia (YC S22) – A mobile app emulator you can share with a link,,"Hi HN! We’re Fabien and Naren, co-founders of Wolfia (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolfia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolfia.com</a>). Wolfia lets you share a link to a mobile emulator running your app. Developers can get feedback instantly on a feature they just built by sharing a link to an interactive version of their app. We’re starting with Android but iOS is coming soon!<p>Mobile app development in 2022 is harder than it should be - you can&#x27;t easily change a line of code, rebuild the app, and have someone on the other side of the world see the result in seconds. Instead of the rapid iterations that web app developers enjoy, mobile app developers are stuck with pushing builds every night and waiting a day for the team to see the new code. That&#x27;s if they even have a nightly build setup. Most people also only have one phone, so they can never test the Android app if they have an iPhone and vice versa.<p>We&#x27;ve been developing mobile apps for over 10 years (at Facebook, Wealthfront, etc.). In that time, the tooling has dramatically improved, yet we still found ourselves having to go and install emulators on a PM&#x27;s laptop and give them commands to copy and paste on the terminal because they didn&#x27;t have an Android phone. Or we would have to procure test phones and wait for a build to be pushed. We’re building Wolfia to finally make this process seamless.<p>Wolfia lets developers send a link to an APK (an Android binary) that&#x27;s running on an emulator accessible via the browser. You can then play with the app without the need for a physical device. This dramatically shortens the feedback loop and completely transforms the dev cycle: from days to hours or even minutes.<p>Product managers and designers can use it to check that a new feature is being built up to their specs. Developers can use it to check if the code is running correctly. Founders, user researchers and salespeople can use it for interactive demos of the product.<p>We host headless (without GUI) Android emulators with hardware acceleration running on AWS bare metal instances to get high performance. We use WebSockets to make a two-way connection between the browser and the emulator through ADB (Android Debug Bridge). The emulator&#x27;s GUI is displayed on the browser via an H.264 video feed, and we relay the user&#x27;s touch events back to the emulator. We use WSS to make this secure.<p>Try it for free at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolfia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolfia.com</a>! (you can try a demo - we used Materialistic, an open source HN app - or sign up for free and upload your own app)<p>We would love to hear your thoughts, ideas and feedback!",Hacker News,70660988

Eke here, co-founder of Genti Audio. Genti Audio is a mobile app for streaming and downloading Africa-focused audiobooks, stories, and podcasts in regional and local African languages.<p>In September 2021, my sister and I sat down to work on an audio show exploring Nigeria’s cultural and linguistic diversity. As we began to put the show together, we realized that our target audience- Nigerians and Africans in both urban and rural areas, were not heavily present on any of the major audio platforms for this type of content. Recognizing this, we decided to first fix this distribution gap, and so the idea for Genti was born.<p>From just an idea, we began pooling resources and soon started developing our beta app. And after months of hard work building, scouring for content, and raising funds from supportive friends and family, we are very excited to announce the launch of our mobile app. We will continue to improve the app and roll out more features over the next 4 months. Download the App now on Google Play or the Apple App Store and start listening!<p>At Genti, our mission is to amplify African stories and voices to entertain, educate, and enrich lives. In line with our mission, we’ll spend the next 3 - 6 months getting the best entertaining and educative African audio content out there and curating for our users. We also believe that for every African story told there are hundreds waiting to be told, and that’s why we’ve begun working on developing engaging original content available exclusively on our platform. Genti is committed to playing a vital role in developing and deepening audio storytelling on the continent.<p>To download the app, visit the Genti website, or download directly from Google Play and the Apple App store and start listening!<p>If you’ve got a podcast, audiobook, or story you’d like to upload on Genti, please send an email to ojiugo@gentimedia.com and we’ll be in touch. We’d also love to get feedback from you on your experience with the Genti App.",Hacker News,78080007

It lets you create a development environment in your cloud provider account easily.<p>You can think of it as a desktop version of Gitpod &#x2F; Coder &#x2F; GitHub Codespaces less polished and with less features but 100% free, 100% open-source and 100% community-driven.<p>At the time of writing, it only works with Visual Studio Code and AWS.<p>In order to let you configure your development environments easily, I’ve chosen to use Docker with some Dockerfiles:<p><pre><code>   - One for your user configuration.
   
   - One for your project.
</code></pre>
The user configuration corresponds to the tools &#x2F; settings that you use in all your projects like your timezone &#x2F; locale, your preferred shell or your dotfiles.<p>The project configuration corresponds to the tools &#x2F; settings that you use in a specific project like Go &gt;= 1.18 and Node.js &gt;= 14.<p>As you may have guessed, the project configuration inherits from the user one.<p>&gt; Why Docker and not something like NixOS, for example?<p>I know that containers are not meant to be used as a VM like that, but, at the time of writing, Docker is still the most widely used tool among developers to configure their environment (even if it may certainly change in the future :-)).<p>&gt; Given that my dev env will run in a container does it mean that it will be limited?<p>Mostly not.<p>Given the scope of this project (a private instance running in your own cloud provider account), Docker is mostly used for configuration purpose and not to &quot;isolate&quot; the VM from your environment.<p>As a result, your development environment container runs in privileged mode in the same network than the host.<p>----<p>I post this here, because, you know, even learning project could be useful to someone.<p>Still learning Go by the way, so I&#x27;m open to any suggestions to improve.",Hacker News,57599617

sumul,32376154,405,1659877289,Show HN: Figure is a daily logic puzzle game,https://figure.game,"Hello, HN! Figure is a little side project I’ve been working on. Someone described it as Bejeweled meets Wordle.<p>I built the puzzle interface and website in Next.js and React, which was a first for me and overall a great learning experience. The daily puzzle data is queued up in a PostgreSQL table. Another table stores anonymous solve stats. Once a day, a cron job hits a serverless API that promotes the next puzzle as “live” and prompts Next.js to update the prebaked static site with the new data. The game state is managed with Redux and your stats are persisted to localStorage. Framer Motion for animations. Styling is mostly Tailwind CSS. I use Figma for design and Logic Pro to make the sounds.<p>I get a lot of questions about how the puzzles are generated. It’s not super sexy. I generate random grids of tiles and then run them through a brute force solver (sounds rough but the puzzles don’t feel anything). Every few days, I play through puzzles that look promising based on the solution space and pick some good ones to go into the queue. The rest are sent back to the void (again, painless).<p>I’ve spent a little bit of time tinkering with a procedural generator, but so far the random ones are better. The downsides of the random approach are (1) the curation effort required, and (2) the high variability in puzzle difficulty. I have a feeling there’s a whole body of math and CS knowledge where Figure is an example of something that I don’t know the name for (imposter syndrome intensifies).<p>As for the future of Figure, I feel strongly about keeping it free of ads, login walls, in-app purchases, or anything else that infringes on enjoyment or privacy. I’d also like to make sure Figure is accessible to everyone. English isn’t exactly required to play, but translations for the UI and website would be nice. I’ve tried to build Figure to be friendly to people who have color vision deficiency and people who rely on screen readers and keyboard navigation, but I have no idea if it’s actually any fun in these cases.<p>Here are some miscellaneous thoughts…<p>1. It’s been surprisingly satisfying to build a web game with a modern frontend stack. I’ve noticed a lot of grumbling on HN over the years from OG web developers who yearn for the days of semantic HTML, a sprinkling of CSS, and vanilla JS. I was in that boat too and have grumbled plenty about the breakneck pace of frontend evolution. One of my goals with this project was to pick some popular frameworks and give them an honest try. I’m now a believer, but there’s still no way I can keep up with all the progress.<p>2. I found Tailwind awkward at first, but after a while I realized I was using Figma a lot less and just designing in code with utility classes, which is great for focus and flow. Having lived through the Web 2.0 standards revolution, it was hard to let go of some deeply rooted opinions about semantic purity, but overall I’m sold.<p>3. I really love side projects. At most jobs, you’re pushed toward specialization. Side projects allow you to build out a generalist skillset, which makes you better at your core job function and better at collaborating with others. It’s also liberating to explore and pivot around without time pressure. Figure started out as a 3D fidget toy in Unity where you fling projectiles at floating objects…<p>4. I made this game on my trusty 2013 MacBook Pro, which has been almost completely sufficient (ahem Docker ಠ_ಠ). I’ll probably get an M2 Air soon, but I’m reluctant to say goodbye to the best computer I’ve ever owned.<p>5. I’m very grateful for the people who build and maintain open source projects. It’s also delightful how many paid services offer generous free tiers to let developers play around: Figma, GitHub, Vercel, Supabase, and Pipedream, just to name a few that I’m currently using actively. If you work on FOSS and&#x2F;or these excellent platforms, thank you.<p>Anyway, hope you like it. Happy to answer any questions.",Hacker News,38391990

Try searching for a medical condition or health issue. The YouTube search results are labelled &#x27;From health sources&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to think of this change. Is it right to remove or deprioritise popular videos from search results if those videos come from unqualified &quot;Doctors&quot;. I presume this also applies to anyone discussing a health topic who is not a health professional.<p>On the other hand, I understand why YouTube has taken this approach. There is a lot of misleading health advice too - it&#x27;s impossible to police it all. YouTube&#x27;s approach is to populate search results from health professionals or &quot;credible health sources&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult problem to tackle.

goncalo-r,32384662,53,1659961645,Show HN: Build for any cloud with the same code,https://github.com/multycloud/multy,"We have been working on Multy, an open-source[1] tool that enables developers to deploy and switch to any cloud - AWS, Azure and GCP for now.<p>We realized that, even when using Terraform, writing infrastructure code is very different for each cloud provider. This means changing clouds or deploying the same infrastructure in multiple clouds requires rewriting the same thing multiple times. And even though most core resources have the same functionality, developers need to learn a new provider and all its nuances when choosing a new cloud. This is why we built Multy.<p>Multy is currently available as a Terraform provider. You can write cloud-agnostic code and then just choose which cloud you want to deploy to. Multy will then call the cloud provider APIs on your behalf. For example, the following Terraform code deploys a virtual network in AWS and can be easily changed to deploy to Azure or GCP:<p>```
resource &quot;multy_virtual_network&quot; &quot;vn&quot; {<p><pre><code>  cloud      = &quot;aws&quot; &#x2F;&#x2F; or azure, or gcp

  name       = &quot;multy_vn&quot;
  cidr_block = &quot;10.0.0.0&#x2F;16&quot;
  location   = &quot;eu_west_1&quot;</code></pre>
}  
```<p>Our goal is to expose any configuration that is common across all clouds, but there’s always specific features that are not available in all of them. For example, if you want a very specific AWS CPU for your Virtual Machine or use a region that is only available in GCP. To enable this, we implemented overrides [2] - a way to configure the underlying infrastructure for cloud-specific purposes. You can also mix other Terraform code that uses the cloud-specific providers with Multy. While this makes you somewhat locked in, having your 80% or 90% of your infrastructure  cloud-agnostic is still very powerful.<p>You can see more complex examples in our documentation - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.multy.dev&#x2F;examples&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.multy.dev&#x2F;examples&#x2F;</a>.<p>We’re still in early days and looking for feedback from other developers on our approach.

Python requires almost nothing (interpreter + editor + a basic understanding of lists&#x2F;dicts and control flow) to get started.<p><i>But</i> do a big project with a large team and you&#x27;ll quickly discover the rough edges and debates - a few that have come up lately for me at work - typing or no typing, oop or functional? pytest or unittest? poetry vs pipenv vs ... ? Occasional runtime errors. Project layout and organization (makes me miss maven sometimes).

barathr,32399347,19,1660059122,Show HN: PGPP (Pretty Good Phone Privacy) – a new type of mobile privacy service,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invisv.pgpp&hl=en_US&gl=US,"Hi, we&#x27;re Barath and Paul. We co-founded INVISV to build Pretty Good Phone Privacy (PGPP) [<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;invisv.com&#x2F;pgpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;invisv.com&#x2F;pgpp</a>], an app and service that provides mobile identifier privacy (IMSI) and Internet privacy (IP) so that neither we nor other providers learn your network identity. We&#x27;ve been thinking about how phones are tracking devices in disguise (at a few layers) and what we can do about it. But the problem is that mobile networks are hard to change, and existing companies are reluctant to change things.<p>A couple years ago we had the idea that we could decouple your identity from your SIM (IMSI), so the mobile operator wouldn&#x27;t know who you are but still provides you service. We did research, figured it out, and published it last year at Usenix Security. Then we took it to every mobile operator we could to see if they&#x27;d do it, but mostly got shrugs, confusion, or hostility. (We still hold out hope they&#x27;ll change their minds.) So we decided we had to build and deploy it ourselves. And the mobile network is just the first part -- we also provide decoupled IP privacy (Relay) in PGPP via a partnership with Fastly, for when you&#x27;re on WiFi or mobile data.<p>The implementation is simple: for mobile privacy we decouple authentication from connectivity. Those are conflated today. We provide service using eSIMs (so you need an eSIM capable Android for this part). So we don&#x27;t learn which eSIM your phone gets each time (your IMSI now changes periodically), we authenticate you with a cryptographic protocol (Chaum&#x27;s blind signatures) that proves you should get a new eSIM but doesn&#x27;t reveal your identity. Then you get mobile data service. This isn&#x27;t something that exists today, despite the tracking&#x2F;data collection that&#x27;s happened both by third parties (SDRs &#x2F; IMSI catchers) and operators themselves. It&#x27;s like MAC randomization for mobile networks.<p>We figured users would like better IP privacy too, so we used IETF MASQUE and collaborated with Fastly to provide relay service in PGPP as well. Relay service works on almost any Android device. This uses TLS to tunnel your traffic (which itself will usually be TLS encrypted, for almost all Web traffic today) through two hops and then to the rest of the Internet. The first hop is us -- we hide your IP but learn nothing of your traffic or where it&#x27;s headed. The second hop is Fastly, who then connects you to the IP of the server you&#x27;re trying to reach, but all they see is an INVISV IP trying to connect to some other IP. The site you&#x27;re connecting to terminates your TLS stream but just sees it coming from Fastly.<p>This is a beta and there are several things that aren&#x27;t ideal. We don&#x27;t have free plans because providing actual connectivity is pretty expensive. We know that data-only mobile service isn&#x27;t for everyone (that&#x27;s what our mobile plans provide -- no phone number). So we offer Relay service on its own for folks who want that. We also know eSIMs are not ideal either, so we&#x27;d like to generalize that down the road.<p>We&#x27;re focused on privacy, not just on mobile, and we&#x27;d love your feedback on the service and ideas about this and where to go next.<p>Thanks!<p>Barath and Paul",Hacker News,25561788

Cost alone cannot be the full explanation as existing resources that were excellent have been actively taken down.<p>I know that UC Berkley&#x27;s videos were taken down for failing to conform to accessibility laws so that it kind of a special case, but it wouldn&#x27;t have been impossible to get them subtitled if the motivation were there.<p>Of course many of these resources can still be found if you search hard enough, and individual Youtube creators have been getting better and better, but I would really be fascinated to hear why there was such an institutional flourish and decline?",Hacker News,20821969

l2g,32377826,17,1659891068,Show HN: Apprise v1.0.0 – A lightweight all-in-one notification solution,https://github.com/caronc/apprise,"I introduced Hacker News to Apprise back when it was just an experiment (and supported just 30 or so notification services at the time). Now supporting more then 85+ services and with a ton of built in features, I officially created it&#x27;s first stable v1.0.0 release marking a major milestone for the project.<p>Apprise doesn&#x27;t compete with other notification services out there; instead it just acts as a proxy (or master switchboard) to support handling messages to them. It&#x27;s a means of decoupling notification support from the systems that want to provide them. The idea is to adopt Apprise into your environment, and then you no longer have to worry about adding&#x2F;removing support for new services as the come along and deprecating the ones that go away.<p>The way it works is that every service out there maps to a `schema:&#x2F;&#x2F;credentials&#x2F;?optional_configuration`. You just need to define the schemas you use, and then you can already use Apprise. Check out the list of the services available today here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise#supported-notifications"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise#supported-notifications</a><p>Apprise is 100% open source (MIT Licensed).  It has an acompanied API I built for those who want to centralize their configuration (found here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise-api</a>).<p>Some reasons you may also all find it useful:<p><pre><code>  - It works perfectly with legacy servers (supporting even Python 2.7).  So this fits system admins using older systems such as CentOS 6+
  - It has a complete API that developers, devops, and administrators alike can leverage allowing them to control the notifications in their environments.
  - It supports configuration files allowing you to securely hide your credentials and map them to simple tags like `family`, `devops`, `marketing`, etc. There is no limit to the number of tag assignments. It supports a simple TEXT (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;config_text) based configuration, as well as a more advanced and configurable YAML (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;config_yaml) based one.
  - It sends all notifications asynchronously optimizing setups where there are many end-points to deliver to.
  - It supports inputs are of MARKDOWN, HTML, and TEXT and can easily convert between these depending on the endpoint. For example: HTML provided input would be converted to TEXT before passing it along as a text message. However the same HTML content provided would not be converted if the endpoint accepted it as such (such as Telegram, or Email). 
  - It supports breaking large messages into smaller ones to fit the upstream service. Hence a text message (160 characters) or a Tweet (280 characters) would be constructed for you if the notification you sent was larger.
  - It supports file attachments too. So feel free to pass along an image, PDF, etc if the destination supports it.
  - It can easily allow you to write your own custom notifications and&#x2F;or simply leverage Apprise as routing service to perform admin tasks for you.  See here for more details: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;decorator_notify
  - It has 100% code based test coverage. :)
</code></pre>
I hope to continue to add more services (and break 100+ supported services someday). I also hope some of you find it useful for your own project solution!",Hacker News,81530685
