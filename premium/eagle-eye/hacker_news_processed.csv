Sematic is an open-source framework to prototype and productionize end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS) pipelines in days instead of weeks or months. The idea is to do for ML development what Rails and Heroku did for web development.<p>I started my career searching for Supersymmetry and the Higgs boson on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, then moved to industry. I spent the last four years building ML infrastructure at Cruise. In both academia and industry, I witnessed researchers, data scientists, and ML engineers spending an absurd share of their time building makeshift tooling, stitching up infrastructure, and battling obscure systems, instead of focusing on their core area of expertise: extracting insights and predictions from data.<p>This was painfully apparent at Cruise where the ML Platform team needed to grow linearly with the number of users to support and models to ship to the car. What should have just taken a click (e.g. retraining a model when world conditions change – COVID parklets, road construction sites, deployment to new cities) often required weeks of painstaking work. Existing tools for prototyping and productionizing ML&#x2F;DS models did not enable developers to become autonomous and tackle new projects instead of babysitting current ones.<p>For example, a widely adopted tool such as Kubeflow Pipelines requires users to learn an obscure Python API, package and deploy their code and dependencies by hand, and does not offer exhaustive tracking and visualization of artifacts beyond simple metadata.<p>In order to become autonomous, users needed a dead-simple way to iterate seamlessly between local and cloud environments (change code, validate locally, run at scale in the cloud, repeat) and visualize objects (metrics, plots, datasets, configs) in a UI.

Wolfia lets you share a link to a mobile emulator running your app. Developers can get feedback instantly on a feature they just built by sharing a link to an interactive version of their app. We’re starting with Android but iOS is coming soon!<p>Mobile app development in 2022 is harder than it should be - you can&#x27;t easily change a line of code, rebuild the app, and have someone on the other side of the world see the result in seconds. Instead of the rapid iterations that web app developers enjoy, mobile app developers are stuck with pushing builds every night and waiting a day for the team to see the new code. That&#x27;s if they even have a nightly build setup. Most people also only have one phone, so they can never test the Android app if they have an iPhone and vice versa.<p>We&#x27;ve been developing mobile apps for over 10 years (at Facebook, Wealthfront, etc.). In that time, the tooling has dramatically improved, yet we still found ourselves having to go and install emulators on a PM&#x27;s laptop and give them commands to copy and paste on the terminal because they didn&#x27;t have an Android phone. Or we would have to procure test phones and wait for a build to be pushed. We’re building Wolfia to finally make this process seamless.<p>Wolfia lets developers send a link to an APK (an Android binary) that&#x27;s running on an emulator accessible via the browser. You can then play with the app without the need for a physical device. This dramatically shortens the feedback loop and completely transforms the dev cycle: from days to hours or even minutes.<p>Product managers and designers can use it to check that a new feature is being built up to their specs. Developers can use it to check if the code is running correctly. Founders, user researchers and salespeople can use it for interactive demos of the product.<p>We host headless (without GUI) Android emulators with hardware acceleration running on AWS bare metal instances to get high performance.

Noether's theorem is an amazing result which lets physicists get
conserved quantities from symmetries of the laws of nature.  Time
translation symmetry gives conservation of energy; space translation
symmetry gives conservation of momentum; rotation symmetry gives
conservation of angular momentum, and so on.
 

This result, proved in 1915 by   shortly after she first arrived in Göttingen, was praised
by Einstein as a piece of ""penetrating mathematical
thinking"".  It's now a standard workhorse in theoretical physics.

Noether's theorem is an amazing result which lets physicists get
conserved quantities from symmetries of the laws of nature.  Time
translation symmetry gives conservation of energy; space translation
symmetry gives conservation of momentum; rotation symmetry gives
conservation of angular momentum, and so on.
 

This result, proved in 1915 by   shortly after she first arrived in Göttingen, was praised
by Einstein as a piece of ""penetrating mathematical
thinking"".  It's now a standard workhorse in theoretical physics.

In a study of patients with locally advanced mismatch repair–deficient (dMMR) rectal cancer, 6 months of treatment with the anti–PD-1 agent dostarlimab-gxly alone led to clinical complete responses in 100% of the study’s first 14 patients. So far, dostarlimab has spared every one of these patients of the need for chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. The compelling results were presented at the 2022 ASCO Annual Meeting by  , Head of the Colorectal Cancer Section",256

A quartz crystal has the special property of piezoelectricity, changing its electrical properties as it vibrates.
Since a crystal can be cut to vibrate at a very precise frequency, quartz oscillators are useful for many applications.
Quartz oscillators were introduced in the 1920s and provided accurate frequencies for radio stations.

A quartz crystal has the special property of piezoelectricity, changing its electrical properties as it vibrates.
Since a crystal can be cut to vibrate at a very precise frequency, quartz oscillators are useful for many applications.
Quartz oscillators were introduced in the 1920s and provided accurate frequencies for radio stations.

goncalo-r,32384662,53,1659961645,Show HN: Build for any cloud with the same code,https://github.com/multycloud/multy,"We have been working on Multy, an open-source[1] tool that enables developers to deploy and switch to any cloud - AWS, Azure and GCP for now.<p>We realized that, even when using Terraform, writing infrastructure code is very different for each cloud provider. This means changing clouds or deploying the same infrastructure in multiple clouds requires rewriting the same thing multiple times. And even though most core resources have the same functionality, developers need to learn a new provider and all its nuances when choosing a new cloud. This is why we built Multy.<p>Multy is currently available as a Terraform provider. You can write cloud-agnostic code and then just choose which cloud you want to deploy to. Multy will then call the cloud provider APIs on your behalf. For example, the following Terraform code deploys a virtual network in AWS and can be easily changed to deploy to Azure or GCP:<p>```
resource &quot;multy_virtual_network&quot; &quot;vn&quot; {<p><pre><code>  cloud      = &quot;aws&quot; &#x2F;&#x2F; or azure, or gcp

  name       = &quot;multy_vn&quot;
  cidr_block = &quot;10.0.0.0&#x2F;16&quot;
  location   = &quot;eu_west_1&quot;</code></pre>
}  
```<p>Our goal is to expose any configuration that is common across all clouds, but there’s always specific features that are not available in all of them. For example, if you want a very specific AWS CPU for your Virtual Machine or use a region that is only available in GCP. To enable this, we implemented overrides [2] - a way to configure the underlying infrastructure for cloud-specific purposes. You can also mix other Terraform code that uses the cloud-specific providers with Multy. While this makes you somewhat locked in, having your 80% or 90% of your infrastructure  cloud-agnostic is still very powerful.<p>You can see more complex examples in our documentation - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.multy.dev&#x2F;examples&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.multy.dev&#x2F;examples&#x2F;</a>.<p>We’re still in early days and looking for feedback from other developers on our approach.

I’ve used in adapting it to mathematics. After reviewing a fact, or re-working some problem, you’re
more familiar with it. If you’re quizzed about that problem
soon after, you’ll be able to effortlessly recall the solution.
But, if you don’t visit this problem for long enough, you’ll eventually forget

to forget it. The idea behind   is to reintroduce ideas and problems

and refreshing your memory.
This is  , because the periods without

We co-founded INVISV to build Pretty Good Phone Privacy (PGPP) [<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;invisv.com&#x2F;pgpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;invisv.com&#x2F;pgpp</a>], an app and service that provides mobile identifier privacy (IMSI) and Internet privacy (IP) so that neither we nor other providers learn your network identity. We&#x27;ve been thinking about how phones are tracking devices in disguise (at a few layers) and what we can do about it. But the problem is that mobile networks are hard to change, and existing companies are reluctant to change things.<p>A couple years ago we had the idea that we could decouple your identity from your SIM (IMSI), so the mobile operator wouldn&#x27;t know who you are but still provides you service. We did research, figured it out, and published it last year at Usenix Security. Then we took it to every mobile operator we could to see if they&#x27;d do it, but mostly got shrugs, confusion, or hostility. (We still hold out hope they&#x27;ll change their minds.) So we decided we had to build and deploy it ourselves. And the mobile network is just the first part -- we also provide decoupled IP privacy (Relay) in PGPP via a partnership with Fastly, for when you&#x27;re on WiFi or mobile data.<p>The implementation is simple: for mobile privacy we decouple authentication from connectivity. Those are conflated today. We provide service using eSIMs (so you need an eSIM capable Android for this part). So we don&#x27;t learn which eSIM your phone gets each time (your IMSI now changes periodically), we authenticate you with a cryptographic protocol (Chaum&#x27;s blind signatures) that proves you should get a new eSIM but doesn&#x27;t reveal your identity. Then you get mobile data service. This isn&#x27;t something that exists today, despite the tracking&#x2F;data collection that&#x27;s happened both by third parties (SDRs &#x2F; IMSI catchers) and operators themselves. It&#x27;s like MAC randomization for mobile networks.<p>We figured users would like better IP privacy too, so we used IETF MASQUE and collaborated with Fastly to provide relay service in PGPP as well. Relay service works on almost any Android device. This uses TLS to tunnel your traffic (which itself will usually be TLS encrypted, for almost all Web traffic today) through two hops and then to the rest of the Internet. The first hop is us -- we hide your IP but learn nothing of your traffic or where it&#x27;s headed. The second hop is Fastly, who then connects you to the IP of the server you&#x27;re trying to reach, but all they see is an INVISV IP trying to connect to some other IP. The site you&#x27;re connecting to terminates your TLS stream but just sees it coming from Fastly.<p>This is a beta and there are several things that aren&#x27;t ideal. We don&#x27;t have free plans because providing actual connectivity is pretty expensive. We know that data-only mobile service isn&#x27;t for everyone (that&#x27;s what our mobile plans provide -- no phone number). So we offer Relay service on its own for folks who want that. We also know eSIMs are not ideal either, so we&#x27;d like to generalize that down the road.<p>We&#x27;re focused on privacy, not just on mobile, and we&#x27;d love your feedback on the service and ideas about this and where to go next.<p>Thanks!<p>Barath and Paul",Hacker News,25561788,"Title: Show HN: PGPP (Pretty Good Phone Privacy) – a new type of mobile privacy service; Content: Hi, we&#x27;re Barath and Paul.

It&#x27;s like MAC randomization for mobile networks.<p>We figured users would like better IP privacy too, so we used IETF MASQUE and collaborated with Fastly to provide relay service in PGPP as well. Relay service works on almost any Android device. This uses TLS to tunnel your traffic (which itself will usually be TLS encrypted, for almost all Web traffic today) through two hops and then to the rest of the Internet. The first hop is us -- we hide your IP but learn nothing of your traffic or where it&#x27;s headed. The second hop is Fastly, who then connects you to the IP of the server you&#x27;re trying to reach, but all they see is an INVISV IP trying to connect to some other IP. The site you&#x27;re connecting to terminates your TLS stream but just sees it coming from Fastly.<p>This is a beta and there are several things that aren&#x27;t ideal. We don&#x27;t have free plans because providing actual connectivity is pretty expensive. We know that data-only mobile service isn&#x27;t for everyone (that&#x27;s what our mobile plans provide -- no phone number). So we offer Relay service on its own for folks who want that. We also know eSIMs are not ideal either, so we&#x27;d like to generalize that down the road.<p>We&#x27;re focused on privacy, not just on mobile, and we&#x27;d love your feedback on the service and ideas about this and where to go next.<p>Thanks!<p>Barath and Paul",921

I know that Ruby has a native toolkit, there&#x27;s scenic for elixir, there&#x27;s livy for python, there&#x27;s Lazarus, there&#x27;s tcl&#x2F;tk, there&#x27;s flutter from go, and well, Java.<p>5. There are also things like V using a custom drawing, or Ring using Allegro&#x2F; Cairo&#x2F; SDL2.<p>But I really dont like Javascript or web view, I also dont like java,and I dont want to rely on google for Dart&#x2F;Flutter.<p>But I would like to be able to program linux GUI apps, where i can have a canvas element, where i can seamlessly draw text, images, vector, 3D graphics (via Vulkan, or if Vulkan is not possible then openGL) etc .<p>I would also like to access the speakers and the printer.<p>I have already listed the UI toolkit that what I am familiar with. My question is : did I miss something?<p>I&#x27;d be open to all knowledge, even crazy niche language with a nice UI toolkit. I am doing it for my own use, and thus won&#x27;t mind the lack of popularity so to say.<p>Of course, this is an open ended question and I can&#x27;t ask this in stackoverflow- thus I decided to ask here. I appreciate all input.<p>Thank you.",587
